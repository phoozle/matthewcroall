title:  "iMac G3 Refurbishment - Getting Started Guide"

The iMac G3 in my opinion is the greatest computers of the last 20 years with it's functional
yet sleek design and bold ambitions (lacking a Floppy Drive).

I never owned an iMac G3 growing up but my cousin had one.

I was PC boy at the time and I never wanted to admit it was better in anyway.
I think retrospectively I realise how great a machine it was and how much I enjoyed
using it; even though it couldn't play my favourite games.
