yet sleek design and bold ambitions (lacking a Floppy Drive).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never owned an iMac G3 growing up but my cousin had one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was PC boy at the time and I never wanted to admit it was better in anyway.
I think retrospectively I realise how great a machine it was and how much I enjoyed
using it; even though it couldn’t play my favourite games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked up a Flower Power iMac G3 reluctantly not realising how rare and special
it was in the G3 collectors community; it is second to the Dalmatian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Be Continued…&lt;/p&gt;
